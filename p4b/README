The check target cleans, compiles and checks the executable.
The dist target creates a tarball with the source code, the Makefile
and the screenshots.
The check target runs 5 simple smoke tests that check the basic

The testing done for this program was very simple. I did not test
it too rigorously with any corner cases.
The checks I included are:
