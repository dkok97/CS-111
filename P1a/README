lab1a.c:

this contains the implementation of the program in accordance to the spec.
Without any arguments, it reads input from the keyboard and outputs to STDOUT
With the shell argument, it passes input/output between the terminal and a shell
that is running /bin/bash
I added a debug argument to help me debug and navigate through the program

Makefile:

It contains 3 targets:

default: builds the program lab1a.c with appropriate flags
clean: deletes the file created by dist and default
dist: creates a tarball for distribution

README:

The README contains descriptions for all the files and the sources
I used.

man pages for: fork(2), waitpid(2), exec(3), pipe(2), kill(3), poll(2)
