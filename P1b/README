lab1b-client.c:

It contains the source code of my client program.
It initiates a socket connection to a server listening on the specified port
and manages the appropriate communication.
It also accepts a --log option to log the messages across the socket
and a --debug option to print statements to stderr to help me debug
and a --compress option that uses zlib to compress the messages.

lab1b-server.c:
It contains the source code of my server program.
It accepts a socket connection from a client and listens on the specified port
and manages the appropriate communication.

that is running bash
It accepts a --debug option to print statements to stderr to help me debug
and a --compress option that uses zlib to compress the messages.
